<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If youâ€™re after a way to supercharge your learning and become smarter, The Feynman Technique might just be the best way to learn absolutely anything. </em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore the method Nobel prize-winning physicist <a href="https://fs.blog/intellectual-giants/richard-feynman/">Richard Feynman</a> used to ensure he understood anything he studied better than anyone else.</p>
<p>There are four steps to <strong>the Feynman Learning Technique</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a concept you want to learn about, start learning.</li>
<li>Write down your explanation of the concept in your own words, as if you were explaining it to a child.</li>
<li>Identify gaps in your explanation;  Go back to the source material, to better understand it.</li>
<li>Review and simplify (optional)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you&#8217;re not learning, you&#8217;re standing still. But how do we get feedback on what we&#8217;re learning? And how do we go about learning new subjects and identifying gaps in our existing knowledge?</p>
<h2> Feynman Facts to the rescue! </h2>
<p> Feynamn Facts is a community of learners, where one can get feedback and identify the gaps in their knowledge easily by the help of others.</p>
